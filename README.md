# Machine Learning Algorithms - Simple and Naive Implementation

As a software engineer with not that strong math background, I had a great difficulty in understanding ML algorithms. It may take me only several minutes to know what an algorithm looks like, but it really takes some time to understand the further details. As a way of learning, I decided to implement some basic ml algorithms from scratch, and this project is the result.

The API is merely a copy from scikit-learn. There’s no parameter check nor any optimization. I tried to focus on the most simple and naive part of these algorithms and keep the code as “dense” as possible.
